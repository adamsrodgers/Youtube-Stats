Perhaps understandably so, considering some are spending Lamborghini money on a Nyan Pop-Tart cat GIF that you anyone watch for free online.\n\nBut is it really all that ridiculous?\n\nIn this video, we\u2019ll explore the potential NFTs hold and why these laughable prices may not be so absurd after all.\n\n#NFT #MarketBubble #HypeTrain\n\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\n\n\u2728Special NFT Highlights \u2b07\ufe0f\u2728\n\nAcquire ownership of the entire EE YouTube channel for $10MM USD (no joke!)\n\u2192 https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/43054914477634394329889595616748437970418716425254999584541130147240083456001\n\nAcquire the NFT of this video about NFTs (yes, seriously)\n\u2192 https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/43054914477634394329889595616748437970418716425254999584541130148339595083777\n\nEconomics of YouTube \n\u2192 https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/43054914477634394329889595616748437970418716425254999584541130126349362528257\n\nOriginal EE logo\n\u2192 https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/43054914477634394329889595616748437970418716425254999584541130146140571828225\n\nEconomics Explained Video (Collage)\n\u2192 https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/43054914477634394329889595616748437970418716425254999584541130139543502061569\n\nWhy are Billions of Dollars Worth of Ships Being Intentionally Destroyed?\n\u2192 https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/43054914477634394329889595616748437970418716425254999584541130030691850911745\n\nNorway: Is It The Perfect Economy?\n\u2192 https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/43054914477634394329889595616748437970418716425254999584541130131846920667137\n\nGoogle Sketchup House Speed Build (EE's very first Google Sketchup video!)\n\u2192 https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/43054914477634394329889595616748437970418716425254999584541130141742525317121\n\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\n\n\ud83d\uddbc The Economics Of The Art Market: Why This Painting Isn't Worth $450 Million\n\n\u2192 https://youtu.be/V5sOuET8UWA\n\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\n\nEnjoyed the video?

In fact, New Zealand is, arguably, the world\u2019s best-managed economy. After considering the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index and various high-ranking Quality of Life and Happiness assessments, it's little wonder as to why consistently ranks New Zealand at the top (move aside, Norway!).\n\nPerhaps even more remarkable is that this tiny island country has achieved remarkable prosperity in spite of not having notable natural resources (or acting as a tax haven for global businesses).\n\nWhat are the primary drivers of New Zealand's economic prosperity?\n\nHow has the nation been able to accommodate these where other nations fail to do so?\n\nAnd what are the challenges the nation might face to keep this success going?\n\n...

Never the less average incomes in China are still less than $15,000 USD\u2019s per year, and that\u2019s average, so in a nation that reports a Gini coefficient of 0.47 with some independent research noting this could be as high as 0.73 that means there are a lot of poor people at home in this economic miracle. \n\nIn plain English, this means upwards of half a billion people in China are living on less than $10 per day, primarily made up of those still living in rural areas.\n\nNow this fact is not lost on the Chinese government, who know that a growing wealth divide in their worker\u2019s paradise is not a great look, especially if that divide is between the cities fueling growth and the farmers feeding them. \n\nThat is why in just the last 5 years the government has poured the equivalent of over 800 billion dollars into aid in area\u2019s where extreme poverty is still commonplace. This is to say nothing on state-owned enterprises which easily bring this running total to over a trillion dollars in the same time period. \n\nA trillion dollars in 5 years, that\u2019s more than the entire GDP of 3 quarters of the world\u2019s countries, on one single welfare project. \n\nEven for a government as wealthy as China\u2019s, this is ultimately not sustainable.\n\nSo a new solution was needed to make these systems more efficient at solving core issues rather than alleviating the symptoms with handfuls of cash.\n\nAnd there might be a lot to take away from what they have done so as always we need to understand a few things. \n\nHow much poverty is there actually left in china?\n\nWhy is this so difficult to measure?\n\nWhy does China care so much?\n\nAnd how might cows be the solution to this whole problem? \n\n\nEnjoyed the video?

Never the less average incomes in China are still less than $15,000 USD\u2019s per year, and that\u2019s average, so in a nation that reports a Gini coefficient of 0.47 with some independent research noting this could be as high as 0.73 that means there are a lot of poor people at home in this economic miracle. \n\nIn plain English, this means upwards of half a billion people in China are living on less than $10 per day, primarily made up of those still living in rural areas.\n\nNow this fact is not lost on the Chinese government, who know that a growing wealth divide in their worker\u2019s paradise is not a great look, especially if that divide is between the cities fueling growth and the farmers feeding them. \n\nThat is why in just the last 5 years the government has poured the equivalent of over 800 billion dollars into aid in area\u2019s where extreme poverty is still commonplace. This is to say nothing on state-owned enterprises which easily bring this running total to over a trillion dollars in the same time period. \n\nA trillion dollars in 5 years, that\u2019s more than the entire GDP of 3 quarters of the world\u2019s countries, on one single welfare project. \n\nEven for a government as wealthy as China\u2019s, this is ultimately not sustainable.\n\nSo a new solution was needed to make these systems more efficient at solving core issues rather than alleviating the symptoms with handfuls of cash.\n\nAnd there might be a lot to take away from what they have done so as always we need to understand a few things. \n\nHow much poverty is there actually left in china?\n\nWhy is this so difficult to measure?\n\nWhy does China care so much?\n\nAnd how might cows be the solution to this whole problem? \n\n\nEnjoyed the video?

                    "description": "Sign-up for Acorns! \ud83d\udc49 https://acorns.com/ee?s2=ARG3 (upon registration, Acorns will deposit $5 in your account to help you get started with investing!)\n\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\n\n\nThis is Argentina, a South American nation which has been home to an unprecedented period of sustained growth quintupling in size in the last decade. \n\nThis nation has seen remarkable resilience through financial crises and even though it cycled through 5 presidents in two weeks, its continued re-investment in itself has paid off many times over as average incomes have doubled in the same time period to create fantastic increases in the quality of life for all the citizens of the nation. \n\nOr at least that would have been the video we were making a few years ago. \n\nUnfortunately today the economy of Argentina tells a very different story.\n\nJust as quickly as the economy soared to these lofty heights it has crashed back down bringing about a period of heavy inflation and widespread poverty. \n\nBut perhaps this shouldn\u2019t be a huge surprise, in the last 100 years the economy of Argentina has been categorized by periods of massive growth followed by huge declines making the most recent decades little more than a continuation of that unfortunate trend.\n\nThis is a real shame because Argentina obviously has a lot going for it, from a healthy population of productive workers, strong natural resource reserves and even a landmass that is very conducive to foundational industries like manufacturing and agriculture. \n\nBut despite all of these advantages Argentina has time and time again fallen into this unfortunate pattern, and is now teetering on the edge of becoming a full-blown failed state. \n\nNobel prize-winning economist Simon Kuznets is said to have remarked in the early 1970\u2019s that there are four types of economies in the world, developed, underdeveloped, Japan and Argentina. \n\nWe have already explored what makes Japan so weird, but to unravel the mystery of Argentina we are going to have to understand a few specific issues. \n\nWhat has caused the various economic booms over the years?\n\nWhat has caused the subsequent economic declines? \n\nAnd why is this most recent downturn just a little bit different? \n\nOnce we have done all of that we can get to the fun stuff and put Argentina on the economics explained national leaderboard, hows that for a 2020 grand final. \n\n\n\nEnjoyed the video?

So stick around, partially because I need that average watch time so that the youtube algorithm may bless this video, but mostly because this bizarre prediction can tell us a lot about possibly the weirdest economy in the world.\n\nThere is a very good reason that Cyprus was singled out as the most likely country to be purchased in the 2020 national yearbook and that is because of its long history of hmmm let\u2019s say being very agreeable to the whim of institutions with a healthy bankroll. \n\nBut of course, the nation is fascinating for so many more reasons not least of which is that half of the country is technically subject to an illegal occupation of the territory of the EU.\n\nAnd it gets even weirder than that, if you were to look at the island of Cyprus you would be forgiven for thinking it is just one little ol country, but depending on who you ask it has as many as 4 different entities claiming sovereignty over what is a very beautiful but otherwise very barren piece of land. \n\nSo there is a lot going on here and as always the best way to make sense of a lot of this is to look at the economics of the island to work out what is truly motivating all of these powerful institutions that apparently want to own Cyprus. \n\nSo\n \nWhat is really driving the economy of Cyprus?\n\nWhy are so many people laying claim to it?\n\nHow have these tensions come back to bit them in recent years?\n\nWhy would it make the ideal country for some global megacorporation like amazon to buy?\n\nAnd of course, once we have made sense of all of that, we can go ahead and put Cyprus on the economics explained national leaderboard. \n\n\n\nEnjoyed the video?

So stick around, partially because I need that average watch time so that the youtube algorithm may bless this video, but mostly because this bizarre prediction can tell us a lot about possibly the weirdest economy in the world.\n\nThere is a very good reason that Cyprus was singled out as the most likely country to be purchased in the 2020 national yearbook and that is because of its long history of hmmm let\u2019s say being very agreeable to the whim of institutions with a healthy bankroll. \n\nBut of course, the nation is fascinating for so many more reasons not least of which is that half of the country is technically subject to an illegal occupation of the territory of the EU.\n\nAnd it gets even weirder than that, if you were to look at the island of Cyprus you would be forgiven for thinking it is just one little ol country, but depending on who you ask it has as many as 4 different entities claiming sovereignty over what is a very beautiful but otherwise very barren piece of land. \n\nSo there is a lot going on here and as always the best way to make sense of a lot of this is to look at the economics of the island to work out what is truly motivating all of these powerful institutions that apparently want to own Cyprus. \n\nSo\n \nWhat is really driving the economy of Cyprus?\n\nWhy are so many people laying claim to it?\n\nHow have these tensions come back to bit them in recent years?\n\nWhy would it make the ideal country for some global megacorporation like amazon to buy?\n\nAnd of course, once we have made sense of all of that, we can go ahead and put Cyprus on the economics explained national leaderboard. \n\n\n\nEnjoyed the video?

A future where the dependent elderly far outweigh the productive young is fast approaching, current pension infrastructure may just not be able to cope. \n\nWe may see a future where the quality of life for elderly citizens rapidly declines, or young people are taxed very heavily in order to support them, neither of which sounds particularly appealing to anyone, so perhaps radical solutions are what we need. \n\nAnd to understand this plan we are going to need to look at a few key areas. \n\nHow would handing out money to babies solve problems amongst the elderly?\n\nHow would nations afford this?\n\nAnd is this actually a sound idea? Or just another scheme by a savvy businessman to profit off front-page news.\n\n\n\nEnjoyed the video?

A future where the dependent elderly far outweigh the productive young is fast approaching, current pension infrastructure may just not be able to cope. \n\nWe may see a future where the quality of life for elderly citizens rapidly declines, or young people are taxed very heavily in order to support them, neither of which sounds particularly appealing to anyone, so perhaps radical solutions are what we need. \n\nAnd to understand this plan we are going to need to look at a few key areas. \n\nHow would handing out money to babies solve problems amongst the elderly?\n\nHow would nations afford this?\n\nAnd is this actually a sound idea? Or just another scheme by a savvy businessman to profit off front-page news.\n\n\n\nEnjoyed the video?

Just 72 hours after it\u2019s announcement a petition to stop it gained 80,000 signatures, which is kind of fair enough. \n\nThe whole premise of this proposal does sound very ominous. Economic plans titled the great something have not exactly had the best track record. \n\nThe fact that this plan is leveraging a disaster, alongside the fact that it is pushing some pretty spicy policies means that major conspiracies have been surfaced ranging from this plan will make us all poorer, all the way up to this plan will make us slaves to the lizard people. \n\nNow in fairness, the marketing around this Great Reset has not helped its case at all. If someone was to try and research what this plan actually was they would be presented with two extremely bizarre adds that explain absolutely nothing, and a 2 hour panel, which was extremely boring even to a major economics nerd like myself, and also kinda equally as unhelpful. \n\nWe know this because well, we had to research this plan to make this video.\n\nSo it sounds like Some Economics need to be Explained \n\nAnd to properly do this we are going to need to answer a few questions. \n\nWhat is The Great Reset actually proposing to do?\n\nDo these ideas have any merit?\n\nWho are the players involved in pushing this agenda?\n\nAnd is this actually a nefarious scheme or just the victim of terrible marketing?\n\n\n\nEnjoyed the video?

Just 72 hours after it\u2019s announcement a petition to stop it gained 80,000 signatures, which is kind of fair enough. \n\nThe whole premise of this proposal does sound very ominous. Economic plans titled the great something have not exactly had the best track record. \n\nThe fact that this plan is leveraging a disaster, alongside the fact that it is pushing some pretty spicy policies means that major conspiracies have been surfaced ranging from this plan will make us all poorer, all the way up to this plan will make us slaves to the lizard people. \n\nNow in fairness, the marketing around this Great Reset has not helped its case at all. If someone was to try and research what this plan actually was they would be presented with two extremely bizarre adds that explain absolutely nothing, and a 2 hour panel, which was extremely boring even to a major economics nerd like myself, and also kinda equally as unhelpful. \n\nWe know this because well, we had to research this plan to make this video.\n\nSo it sounds like Some Economics need to be Explained \n\nAnd to properly do this we are going to need to answer a few questions. \n\nWhat is The Great Reset actually proposing to do?\n\nDo these ideas have any merit?\n\nWho are the players involved in pushing this agenda?\n\nAnd is this actually a nefarious scheme or just the victim of terrible marketing?\n\n\n\nEnjoyed the video?

The nation has an incredibly strong social security system, with universal healthcare, robust retirement pensions, as well as allowances for maternity leave.\n\nAnd These kinds of policies are mirrored in other areas as well, the nation is home to relatively high tax rates, and the protections for employees are very strong almost to the point that people joke it is impossible to be fired in the Netherlands. \n\nSo this kind of looks like a liberal paradise right? Well, it would if it were not hiding a dirty little secret. \n\nThis postcard-perfect little nation is according to the world bank the most unequal place on earth, and the extent of the inequality is simply staggering. \n\nWe have explored south Africa on the channel before, which normally gets this less than a desirable title. And if you were to pose this question to google, it\u2019s what you would walk away thinking. But this isn\u2019t the whole story.\n\nIn terms of wealth inequality in recent years, South Africa has been pretty tame. The Netherlands by contrast is the only country on earth that is more unequal than the world itself.\n\nSo what is going on here?\n\nSimilar policies to the ones that have been commonplace in the Netherlands for decades are being proposed by politicians in places like the United States as a way to curb the issue of wealth inequality. But if we look at the results it doesn\u2019t look like they will do that at all. \n\nSo, to really understand this we are going to look at a few key issues.\n\nHow did the Netherlands of all places become the land of inequality?\n\nWhat does this teach us about the nature of wealth in the modern world?\n\nAnd how can this help us create more robust economic policies that work to benefit everyone?\n\nAnd of course, while we are here we will call this a country video and put the Netherlands on the economics explained leaderboard.\n\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\n\nEnjoyed the video?

Well, it would if it were not hiding a dirty little secret. \n\nThis postcard-perfect little nation is according to the world bank the most unequal place on earth, and the extent of the inequality is simply staggering. \n\nWe have explored south Africa on the channel before, which normally gets this less than a desirable title. And if you were to pose this question to google, it\u2019s what you would walk away thinking. But this isn\u2019t the whole story.\n\nIn terms of wealth inequality in recent years, South Africa has been pretty tame. The Netherlands by contrast is the only country on earth that is more unequal than the world itself.\n\nSo what is going on here?\n\nSimilar policies to the ones that have been commonplace in the Netherlands for decades are being proposed by politicians in places like the United States as a way to curb the issue of wealth inequality. But if we look at the results it doesn\u2019t look like they will do that at all. \n\nSo, to really understand this we are going to look at a few key issues.\n\nHow did the Netherlands of all places become the land of inequality?\n\nWhat does this teach us about the nature of wealth in the modern world?\n\nAnd how can this help us create more robust economic policies that work to benefit everyone?\n\nAnd of course, while we are here we will call this a country video and put the Netherlands on the economics explained leaderboard.\n\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\n\nEnjoyed the video?

At the end of the day, they tend to be a slightly more pro-business party.\n\nInstead what they got was an extremely contentious Democratic victory with the potential to bring turbulence around key issues like covid relief packages in the coming month. \n\nSo what is going on here\n\nWhy have markets rallied so hard in spite of this turbulence\n\nWill this market boom reverse if the proposed policies of the Bidens campaign are rolled out.\n\nAnd could it just be that investors no longer favored trump as president?\n\n\nEnjoyed the video?

At the end of the day, they tend to be a slightly more pro-business party.\n\nInstead what they got was an extremely contentious Democratic victory with the potential to bring turbulence around key issues like covid relief packages in the coming month. \n\nSo what is going on here\n\nWhy have markets rallied so hard in spite of this turbulence\n\nWill this market boom reverse if the proposed policies of the Bidens campaign are rolled out.\n\nAnd could it just be that investors no longer favored trump as president?\n\n\nEnjoyed the video?

So Kazakhstan kind of just translates to a land of Kazaks, which are the ancestral people of the nation. \n\nHopefully, that gives some clarity to this rather samey naming scheme in and around this area. \n\nBut all of this is to say that Kazakhstan hasn\u2019t and won\u2019t have it easy in its quest to become a properly developed nation but that doesn\u2019t mean that it can\u2019t do it. \n\nSo to see what is behind this countries stubborn development we need to look at a few key areas.\n\nWhat went on under Soviet rule?\n\nWhat has the country been up to since the collapse?\n\nwhat is their plan for the future?\n\nOh, and of course while we are here we have to put the nation on the Economics Explained national leaderboard.\n\n\nEnjoyed the video?

So Kazakhstan kind of just translates to a land of Kazaks, which are the ancestral people of the nation. \n\nHopefully, that gives some clarity to this rather samey naming scheme in and around this area. \n\nBut all of this is to say that Kazakhstan hasn\u2019t and won\u2019t have it easy in its quest to become a properly developed nation but that doesn\u2019t mean that it can\u2019t do it. \n\nSo to see what is behind this countries stubborn development we need to look at a few key areas.\n\nWhat went on under Soviet rule?\n\nWhat has the country been up to since the collapse?\n\nwhat is their plan for the future?\n\nOh, and of course while we are here we have to put the nation on the Economics Explained national leaderboard.\n\n\nEnjoyed the video?

Auctions and Auction Theory are one of the most important systems to understand in economics because they act as an efficient way to build markets and correctly determine how we value items. \n\nRemember amongst everything economics is simply a study of how people interact with things of value. \n\nSo with that in mind\n\nWhat should the average person or aspiring economist know about Auction Theory?\n\nWhat did the winners of this year's Nobel prize contribute to this theory?\n\nAnd how can this be utilized to build better and more efficient economies?\n\n\n#Auctions #NobelPrize #Economics\n\nEnjoyed the video?

Auctions and Auction Theory are one of the most important systems to understand in economics because they act as an efficient way to build markets and correctly determine how we value items. \n\nRemember amongst everything economics is simply a study of how people interact with things of value. \n\nSo with that in mind\n\nWhat should the average person or aspiring economist know about Auction Theory?\n\nWhat did the winners of this year's Nobel prize contribute to this theory?\n\nAnd how can this be utilized to build better and more efficient economies?\n\n\n#Auctions #NobelPrize #Economics\n\nEnjoyed the video?
