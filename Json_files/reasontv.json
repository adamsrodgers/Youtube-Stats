Rasmussen, author of \"Fears of a Setting Sun: The Disillusionment of America's Founders.\"\n\n------------------\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/ReasonTV?sub_confirmation=1\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reason.Magazine/\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/reason\n\nReason is the planet's leading source of news, politics, and culture from a libertarian perspective. Go to reason.com for a point of view you won't get from legacy media and old left-right opinion magazines.\n----------------\nFor those who predict that the American experiment can't last, and who worry the social fabric is disintegrating at a time of rising political division, it's worth remembering that back when the ink had barely dried on the Constitution, the founding fathers' were deeply pessimistic about the future of the country they had created. \n\nHamilton called the Constitution a \"frail and worthless fabric.\" Washington lamented the growth of political factions. Adams thought a lack of civic virtue doomed the republic. Jefferson watched sectional divisions between North and South with horror, calling the \"sacrifice\" made \"by the generation of '76\" \"useless,\" because it would be  \"thrown away by the unwise and unworthy passions of their sons.\"  \"My only consolation,\" he wrote, \"is to be that I live not to weep over it.\"\n\n\"Their pronouncements may seem overly dramatic to the modern ear,\" says Syracuse University professor Dennis C. Rasmussen. In his latest book, Fears of a Setting Sun, Rassmussen wrestles with the founders near universal pessimism in the future of the country they created. \n\n\"I think that's because they thought that so much was at stake. They really thought that the future of Republican government and the future of human liberty was riding on this American experiment. And so the potential failure of that experiment, they thought would be a world historical calamity.\"\n\nShould Americans see the founders' dissolution as a sign that America is flawed beyond hope? After all, we're still beset by many of the fears the founders identified. \n\n\"We hear people pronounce the end of American democracy at every turn,\" says Rasmussen. \"The fact that it hasn't ended in the past 230 years suggests that maybe [it will] last a good deal longer.\"\n\n\"But the fact that these problems have been with us since the very outset, since the founders themselves, suggest that they might be more systemic, more baked in than we sometimes dare to hope.\"\n\nProduced and edited by Meredith Bragg.",

Go to reason.com for a point of view you won't get from legacy media and old left-right opinion magazines.\n----------------\nFor those who predict that the American experiment can't last, and who worry the social fabric is disintegrating at a time of rising political division, it's worth remembering that back when the ink had barely dried on the Constitution, the founding fathers' were deeply pessimistic about the future of the country they had created. \n\nHamilton called the Constitution a \"frail and worthless fabric.\" Washington lamented the growth of political factions. Adams thought a lack of civic virtue doomed the republic. Jefferson watched sectional divisions between North and South with horror, calling the \"sacrifice\" made \"by the generation of '76\" \"useless,\" because it would be  \"thrown away by the unwise and unworthy passions of their sons.\"  \"My only consolation,\" he wrote, \"is to be that I live not to weep over it.\"\n\n\"Their pronouncements may seem overly dramatic to the modern ear,\" says Syracuse University professor Dennis C. Rasmussen. In his latest book, Fears of a Setting Sun, Rassmussen wrestles with the founders near universal pessimism in the future of the country they created. \n\n\"I think that's because they thought that so much was at stake. They really thought that the future of Republican government and the future of human liberty was riding on this American experiment. And so the potential failure of that experiment, they thought would be a world historical calamity.\"\n\nShould Americans see the founders' dissolution as a sign that America is flawed beyond hope? After all, we're still beset by many of the fears the founders identified. \n\n\"We hear people pronounce the end of American democracy at every turn,\" says Rasmussen. \"The fact that it hasn't ended in the past 230 years suggests that maybe [it will] last a good deal longer.\"\n\n\"But the fact that these problems have been with us since the very outset, since the founders themselves, suggest that they might be more systemic, more baked in than we sometimes dare to hope.\"\n\nProduced and edited by Meredith Bragg."

Go to reason.com for a point of view you won't get from legacy media and old left-right opinion magazines.\n----------------\nOn September 4, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) halted residential evictions in the United States for nonpayment of rent due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many states and municipalities got there first, imposing at least partial eviction moratoriums starting in March and April of 2020. The theory behind these emergency orders was that if Americans were forced to leave their homes and move into more crowded settings, it would increase transmission of COVID-19.\n\nThe federal ban was supposed to expire at the end of 2020. Then it was extended a month, then two more months, then through the end of June, and then last week, the CDC extended it again until the end of July. Many states and cities have also extended their moratoriums\u2014in some cases through the end of September, even as COVID-19 infection and death rates are plummeting.\n\nWere the eviction bans necessary to protect public health during the pandemic? Two studies that got widespread media attention, and that have been cited by the federal government to support its policies, claim to show that the moratoriums saved thousands of lives. \n\n\"Researchers estimated that the lifting of moratoriums could have resulted in between 365,200 and 502,200 excess coronavirus cases and between 8,900 and 12,500 excess deaths,\" noted NPR, in an interview with postdoctoral researcher Kathryn Leifheit of UCLA's Fielding School of Public Health.\n\nLeifheit was the lead author of \"Expiring Eviction Moratoriums and COVID-19 Incidence and Mortality,\" a study cited by the CDC in its order extending the federal moratorium. (Leifheit didn't respond to Reason's interview request.) \n\nThe second study, which also makes dramatic claims about the eviction moratoriums, was authored by a team of researchers at Duke University. It got widespread media attention and was cited twice by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in the federal register as justification for its rulemaking. \n\nThese studies are deeply flawed. Their underlying data are incomplete and inconsistent. Their results are implausible. The size of the effect is wildly disproportionate to other public health interventions. The researchers also claim an absurd amount of certainty in their results despite the large uncertainties in the data they use, and they assert a causal effect based solely on correlation.\n\nIf the authors were correct, they would have arrived at one of the greatest public health discoveries in history. It took over a year and perhaps $100 billion to reduce COVID-19 rates by 40 percent with vaccinations; the Duke researchers claim that if a universal eviction moratorium had been implemented six months earlier, it could have reduced death rates by over 40 percent. Researchers have struggled to demonstrate the benefits of masks, social distancing, and lockdowns with high levels of certainty. Yet these eviction moratorium researchers find high confidence for a gigantic immediate effect from a legal change affecting a tiny subset of the population.\n\nFinally, the authors of the Duke study declined to share their dataset with Reason for scrutiny on the grounds that it hasn't yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, which not only raises additional red flags but is a violation of basic research ethics\u2014particularly in the case of a study that's been widely reported on in the media and is cited by a government agency as justification for federal policies.\n\nProduced and edited by Justin Monticello.

Gavin Newsom? Caitlyn Jenner? That guy with a bear? Or maybe just vote for the damn bear.\n\nBear won't raise your taxes. Bear won't greenlight a poorly-thought-out high-speed rail project. Bear won't violate his own mandates and eat indoors at a fancy restaurant.\n\nHe's a bear. He's just going to do bear things.\n\nThe only hole bear will dig himself is the one he sleeps in all winter long, helping conserve energy and limiting the need for rolling blackouts.\n\nBear doesn't want to interfere in your life. Bear doesn't want to be near people at all.\u00a0You mind your business, Bear will mind his.

Go to reason.com for a point of view you won't get from legacy media and old left-right opinion magazines.\n----------------\n\nThe American Enterprise Institute sociologist Scott Winship says that Americans are prone to believing \"declension narratives,\" or stories about how the Golden Age ended sometime in the past and we have the bad luck to live in a world that is uniquely awful, unfair, and corrupt. Three of today's most prominent and influential declension narratives hold that we're having fewer children because they cost too much money, the rich have captured all the economic gains of the past several decades as income inequality has increased, and that economic mobility has effectively ended.\n\nWinship says such stories are incomplete at best and completely false at worst. He finds that millennial women are more likely to hit their fertility goals than boomer women, strongly suggesting that having fewer children is a cultural choice, not an economic hardship. The Gini coefficient, which measures inequality, has stayed relatively flat since 1989, especially when after-tax transfers are taken into account. Over the same time period, the inflation-adjusted median household income has increased by about $25,000 even as poverty has declined. Contrary to scare stories about younger Americans doing worse than their parents, Winship finds that about 70 percent of 30-year-olds are doing better than their parents at the same age.\n\nFor a full discussion of these topics between Nick Gillespie and Winship, go here.\u00a0[Swapped out original link, which went straight to his general profile; this one is the specific recording.]\n\n\nProduced by Noor Greene; written and narrated by Nick Gillespie; audio by Ian Keyser; additional graphics by Isaac Reese.\n\nMusic: Aerial Cliff by Michele Nobler, Artlist.\nPhotos: CNP/AdMedia/SIPA/Newscom, CNP/AdMedia/SIPA/Newscom, ZUMAPRESS/Newscom, Photo 85015883 \u00a9 Joe Sohm | Dreamstime.com,\u00a0College of DuPage Flicker.\n\nVideos: archive.org",

Latin American ex-pats don't garner headlines or donate much to political campaigns, but they have grit and talent that was largely wasted in the socialist countries from which they fled\u2014not to mention their cultural aversion to big government liberalism and the woke ideology now prevalent in the Bay Area.\n\nMiami's ascendence in the 21st Century hinges on whether it can continue to fulfill its role as the greatest city in Latin America that just happens to be located in the United States.\n\nWritten and narrated by Daniel Raisbeck; shot and edited by John Osterhoudt; opening edited by Paul Detrick; graphic design by Nathalie Walker; animation by NODEHAUS, and Isaac Reese; color correction by Regan Taylor; additional audio production by Ian Keyser.\n\nPhotos: Brian Solis/Wikimedia/Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic; Illustration 107693289 \u00a9 Realcallahan | Dreamstime.com;ID 55131105 \u00a9 Vadymvdrobot | Dreamstime.com; Photo 6613609 \u00a9 Rachwal | Dreamstime.com; Photo 37552835 \u00a9 Asafta | Dreamstime.com; Photo 56569948 \u00a9 Fotopoly | Dreamstime.com; Photo 181915347 \u00a9 Coatchristophe | Dreamstime.com; Photo 91505069 \u00a9 Asafta | Dreamstime.com; Photo 12385033 \u00a9 Jodielee | Dreamstime.com; Photo 54358909 \u00a9 Stefanocapra | Dreamstime.com;Illustration 881755 \u00a9 Steven Wright | Dreamstime.com; Photo 181915347 \u00a9 Coatchristophe | Dreamstime.com; Photo 134786561 \u00a9 Kmiragaya | Dreamstime.com; Photo 88609881 \u00a9 Viocara | Dreamstime.com; Photo 201768295 \u00a9 mikechapazzo | Dreamstime.com; Photo 134786323 \u00a9 Kmiragaya | Dreamstime.com; Photo 176647322 \u00a9 Meunierd | Dreamstime.com; Photo 180601283 \u00a9 Nednae | Dreamstime.com; Photo 54605132 \u00a9 Eagleflying | Dreamstime.com; Photo 195269738 \u00a9 Photovs | Dreamstime.com; Monica Herndon/ZUMA Press/Newscom 024371; Jim Tuten/ZUMA Press/Newscom 87952; Keystone Pictures USA / ZUMA Press/Newscom 232139; Tim Chapman /KRT/Newscom 169568; Lou Toman/KRT/Newscom 064539; KRT/Newscom 000688; St Petersburg Times/ZUMAPRESS/Newscom 833549; Giorgio Viera/EFE/Newscom; Aronovsky/ZUMAPRESS/Newscom"

Early on, the surgeon general admonished Americans for buying masks. As late as last August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was downplaying broad-based testing among asymptomatic people. It wasn't until this April\u2014more than a year into the pandemic\u2014that the agency finally acknowledged what had become clear only a few months in: COVID-19 is rarely spread by surface contact. It's primarily an airborne disease.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stood in the way as independent labs worked to quickly develop COVID-19 tests that would allow individuals to know if they were infected and should self-quarantine, and it wasn't until this spring that the agency finally approved an at-home test you could get without a prescription. The FDA also temporarily pulled Johnson & Johnson's vaccine from the U.S. market because one out of every 1.13 million recipients developed blood clots. Those are the same odds of being struck by lightning.\n\nThe one clear policy victory\u2014Operation Warp Speed, which promised payments to developers of coronavirus vaccines\u2014was based on biomedical innovations such as \"messenger RNA\" vaccines\u2014that were already underway before the novel coronavirus appeared. \"The horrors of the last year have spurred humanity to quickly develop an unprecedentedly flexible and powerful toolkit that may well make COVID-19 the last true pandemic,\" writes Reason Science Correspondent Ronald Bailey in the May cover story for the magazine.\n\n\"The amazing thing is that we'll be able to forestall any further pandemics in the future because so many great advancements in vaccine treatments\u2026have come out of that,\" he tells Reason TV. \"Now you can just slip any piece of genetic information into that lipid and now you have a vaccine.\"\nSafe and effective COVID-19 vaccines were produced far faster than any expert expected. Yet almost all of the time that it took to bring the vaccines to market was due to safety testing and other governmental mandates that could have been sped up without endangering anyone. By January 13, 2020\u2014only two days after the Chinese researchers shared the genetic sequence of the COVID-19 virus and before most Americans had heard of the disease\u2014the biotech company Moderna had devised the formula for its vaccine. BioNTech launched its COVID-19 vaccine program in January and had partnered with Pfizer to manufacture it by mid-March of last year. The first volunteer was injected with Moderna's vaccine on March 16, 2020, yet it was only approved by the FDA last December 17th, a week after Pfizer's vaccine met the agency's approval.

That would have conceivably saved hundreds of thousands of lives globally.\n\nWill our government allow a vaccine based on this plug-and-play model to be deployed not within months, but in a matter of weeks, to stop the next pandemic in its tracks? \"My answer is to let us deploy the technologies as quickly as possible, and then we won't have to make any of these trade-offs ever again,\" says Bailey. \"If we have another pandemic and another failure [like with COVID-19], it will be a policy failure.

                "description": "The data behind apocalypse 2030 is based on placing blame, not predicting the future.\n\nFor full text, links, and credits, go to: https://reason.com/video/2021/04/30/12-years-to-disaster-how-climate-activists-distort-the-evidence/\n------------------\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/ReasonTV?sub_confirmation=1\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reason.Magazine/\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/reason\n\nReason is the planet's leading source of news, politics, and culture from a libertarian perspective. Go to reason.com for a point of view you won't get from legacy media and old left-right opinion magazines.\n----------------\nMany officials and climate activists claim we have only 12 years to act on global warming. Where does this figure come from? A 2018 Special Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The second sentence of that document reads, \"Global warming is likely to reach 1.5 degrees C between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate.\" The 12-year figure comes from subtracting the year of the report, 2018, from the earliest possible date of 1.5 degrees C warming, 2030.\u00a0\n\nThe problem is that this was a statement about the past, dressed up to suggest that it's about the future. It's not about what will happen; it's extrapolating from what has already happened. Actual temperatures in 2030 will depend on whether warming speeds up or slows down, and also on whether the year is warmer or colder than the long-term trend.\n\nWhy the 22-year range? The authors of the IPCC report defined the current rate using data from 1960 to 2017. Using the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) land-ocean temperature series that underpins most popular reporting about warming, global excess temperatures were 0 in January 1960 and 0.94 degrees C in December 2017. So the Earth has to warm another 0.56 degrees C to reach 1.5 degrees C. Some fifth-grade math tells us that should happen in 34.55 years if warming continues at the same rate. We'd hit 1.5 degrees C on July 21, 2051. Different measurements might give a couple of years either way, but not 22 years.\n\nThe range of 2030 to 2052 is not about how warm the earth is but who's responsible for the change in temperature. The figures reflect \"anthropogenic warming,\" or warming rooted in human activity. By citing a range of 2030 to 2052, the authors are indicating a high level of uncertainty. They're not sure how much of the 0.17 degrees C per decade warming is \"anthropogenic,\" or rooted in human activity. They think it's possible that humans are warming the Earth 0.3 degrees C and some unknown factor is actually cooling the Earth 0.13 degrees C. (The IPCC declined to make any of the report's authors available for an interview).\n\nIf you think the problem with global warming is hotter temperatures (melting ice, rising sea levels, and other physical effects), then you should care about the year 2052, not 2030. But if you think the problem with global warming is that humans are tampering with something pristine\u2014and you only consider the worst possible scenario\u2014then 2030 is your date. Focusing on anthropogenic warming suggests that what's happening in the real world matters less than who's at fault.\n\nProduced and edited by Justin Monticello.

                "description": "\"There's this growing gap between what's on paper and what is enforceable in law,\" says Kareem Shaya, the co-founder of Open Source Defense.\n\nFull text and links here: https://reason.com/video/2021/04/22/bidens-plan-to-stop-ghost-guns-is-doomed-to-fail/\n------------------\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/ReasonTV?sub_%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reason.Magazine\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/reason\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nReason is the planet's leading source of news, politics, and culture from a libertarian perspective. Go to reason.com for a point of view you won't get from legacy media and old left-right opinion magazines.\n----------------\n\nOn April 8, President Joe Biden requested that the Department of Justice (DOJ) issue a new rule banning the creation of so-called ghost guns as one of a handful of executive actions meant to curb gun violence following the recent mass shootings in Atlanta, Georgia, and Boulder, Colorado.\n\nGhost guns are unregistered firearms that weren't assembled by licensed gun manufacturers or sold in highly regulated gun shops, and they're most closely associated with Cody Wilson, the founder of Defense Distributed. Wilson first drew attention as the creator of the Liberator, a functional plastic gun that could be manufactured at home using a 3D printer.\u00a0\n\nToday, Defense Distributed's signature product is the Ghost Gunner, a do-it-yourself milling machine the size of small printer that enables anyone with enough time and interest to create unregistered firearms simply by purchasing parts online, downloading specs from an online library like Wilson's DEFCAD, and assembling the final product.\n\nWilson says the units fly off the shelves every time a major politician so much as mentions gun control.\n\n\"As soon as Biden says, 'in 30 days you're going to lose your ghost guns,' everyone's like, 'I gotta buy a ghost gun!'\" says Wilson.\n\nWilson is back at the helm of Defense Distributed after stepping away in 2018, following allegations that he paid a 16-year-old for sex after they met on the adult app Sugar Daddy Meet. The legal age of consent in Texas is 17 years old, and Wilson's defense team maintained that he believed her to be an adult. His plea deal required him to pay restitution, perform community service, register as a sex offender, and serve seven years probation that discourages him from purchasing new firearms.\u00a0\n\nDefense Distributed has been fighting off federal and state legal challenges since its founding in 2012. Biden's requested rule change is the latest front in that legal battle. The president was vague on the details, but he has asked the DOJ to issue a new rule on ghost guns within 30 days.\u00a0\n\nWilson anticipates that the proposed regulation will classify more gun parts, such as the unfinished lower receiver that the Ghost Gunner modifies, as firearms that would each require registration numbers branded on them.\n\nThat was the rule change proposed by the nonprofit gun control advocacy organization Everytown for Gun Safety, which was founded by former New York City mayor and philanthropist Michael Bloomberg.\n\nWilson believes the rule change could drive up demand for DIY guns.\u00a0\n\n\"If it's actually more difficult to buy an [AR-15] upper receiver\u2026because it's serialized and now I gotta go through the background check and everything, I'm now going to consider for the first time making an [AR-15] upper receiver,\" says Wilson.\u00a0\n\nProduced by Zach Weissmueller.

Go to reason.com for a point of view you won't get from legacy media and old left-right opinion magazines.\n----------------\n\nOn April 8, President Joe Biden requested that the Department of Justice (DOJ) issue a new rule banning the creation of so-called ghost guns as one of a handful of executive actions meant to curb gun violence following the recent mass shootings in Atlanta, Georgia, and Boulder, Colorado.\n\nGhost guns are unregistered firearms that weren't assembled by licensed gun manufacturers or sold in highly regulated gun shops, and they're most closely associated with Cody Wilson, the founder of Defense Distributed. Wilson first drew attention as the creator of the Liberator, a functional plastic gun that could be manufactured at home using a 3D printer.\u00a0\n\nToday, Defense Distributed's signature product is the Ghost Gunner, a do-it-yourself milling machine the size of small printer that enables anyone with enough time and interest to create unregistered firearms simply by purchasing parts online, downloading specs from an online library like Wilson's DEFCAD, and assembling the final product.\n\nWilson says the units fly off the shelves every time a major politician so much as mentions gun control.\n\n\"As soon as Biden says, 'in 30 days you're going to lose your ghost guns,' everyone's like, 'I gotta buy a ghost gun!'\" says Wilson.\n\nWilson is back at the helm of Defense Distributed after stepping away in 2018, following allegations that he paid a 16-year-old for sex after they met on the adult app Sugar Daddy Meet. The legal age of consent in Texas is 17 years old, and Wilson's defense team maintained that he believed her to be an adult. His plea deal required him to pay restitution, perform community service, register as a sex offender, and serve seven years probation that discourages him from purchasing new firearms.\u00a0\n\nDefense Distributed has been fighting off federal and state legal challenges since its founding in 2012. Biden's requested rule change is the latest front in that legal battle. The president was vague on the details, but he has asked the DOJ to issue a new rule on ghost guns within 30 days.\u00a0\n\nWilson anticipates that the proposed regulation will classify more gun parts, such as the unfinished lower receiver that the Ghost Gunner modifies, as firearms that would each require registration numbers branded on them.\n\nThat was the rule change proposed by the nonprofit gun control advocacy organization Everytown for Gun Safety, which was founded by former New York City mayor and philanthropist Michael Bloomberg.\n\nWilson believes the rule change could drive up demand for DIY guns.\u00a0\n\n\"If it's actually more difficult to buy an [AR-15] upper receiver\u2026because it's serialized and now I gotta go through the background check and everything, I'm now going to consider for the first time making an [AR-15] upper receiver,\" says Wilson.\u00a0\n\nProduced by Zach Weissmueller.

Go to reason.com for a point of view you won't get from legacy media and old left-right opinion magazines.\n----------------\nWith President Joe Biden issuing a flurry of executive actions last week to strengthen federal gun laws, state representatives across the country are working in the opposite direction, taking a page from the playbook of immigration activists by advancing legislation that would make their enforcement illegal. On April 6, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey, a Republican, signed the first gun control nullification bill into law.\n\n\"Nullifying unconstitutional, federal laws is both legal and it's also the right thing to do,\" says Anthony Sabatini, a Republican lawmaker and member of the Florida House of Representatives. \"It's silly to sit around and wait for something you know is unconstitutional,\" he tells Reason. \"It's time to stand up and fight back. And the methods that we need to use are the ones already being used by the left.\"\n\nIn 1987, Oregon passed a law prohibiting state and local law enforcement from using public resources to arrest or detain people whose only crime was being in the country illegally. Since then, hundreds of other jurisdictions have passed similar laws, becoming so-called sanctuary cities.\n\nConservative activists are employing the same strategy. While Arizona is the only state where such a bill has become law, elected officials have introduced similar bills in more than a dozen statehouses.\n\n\"We know this stuff has been working and the right can continue to complain about the things that the left is successful at, or they can look at it, learn from it, and replicate it,\" Michael Boldin, the founder and executive director of the Tenth Amendment Center, tells Reason.\n\nSabatini is cosponsoring a bill in Florida called the \"Second Amendment Preservation Act\" that would prohibit any employee of the state of Florida from enforcing, or attempting to enforce \"any federal act, law, executive order, administrative order, court order, rule, regulation, statute, or ordinance infringing on the right to keep and bear arms ensured by the Second Amendment.\" \n\nDefying federal law is something that a majority of states already do in one way or another, by becoming immigration sanctuaries or through the legalization and decriminalization of marijuana and other drugs that federal law still deems illegal.\n\n\"In terms of the method it's identical,\" says Sabatini. In sanctuary cities, \"they stopped reporting to or dealing with I.C.E., and that's basically what we're doing.\"\n\nBoldin says that for the nullification movement to succeed against gun control laws and beyond, more Americans will have to recognize that the most effective way to oppose federal policies that violate their rights is at the local level.\n\n\"The whole idea of federalism is so important because it's the only way you can have a country with a few hundred million people living together with a wide range of social, economic, political viewpoints together in peace. What's right for people in California is probably not right for people in South Carolina and vice versa. And when we see things that come down from a one-size-fits-all centralized solution, I don't think anyone really ever gets what they want.\"\n\nBecause 36 states have nullified federal marijuana prohibition, Boldin argues, there's mounting pressure for the federal government to follow suit. \"I think we can replicate that on other issues and learn that localism is really the way forward for liberty.\"\n\nProduced by John Osterhoudt, additional camera by Zach Weissmueller, color correction by Regan Taylor, additional graphics by Isaac Reese\n\nPhotos: Alex Milan Tracy/Sipa USA/Newscom; Nicole Neri/Reuters/Newscom; The Mises Institute; Jeff Malet Photography/Newscom.",

Go to reason.com for a point of view you won't get from legacy media and old left-right opinion magazines.\n----------------\nWith President Joe Biden issuing a flurry of executive actions last week to strengthen federal gun laws, state representatives across the country are working in the opposite direction, taking a page from the playbook of immigration activists by advancing legislation that would make their enforcement illegal. On April 6, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey, a Republican, signed the first gun control nullification bill into law.\n\n\"Nullifying unconstitutional, federal laws is both legal and it's also the right thing to do,\" says Anthony Sabatini, a Republican lawmaker and member of the Florida House of Representatives. \"It's silly to sit around and wait for something you know is unconstitutional,\" he tells Reason. \"It's time to stand up and fight back. And the methods that we need to use are the ones already being used by the left.\"\n\nIn 1987, Oregon passed a law prohibiting state and local law enforcement from using public resources to arrest or detain people whose only crime was being in the country illegally. Since then, hundreds of other jurisdictions have passed similar laws, becoming so-called sanctuary cities.\n\nConservative activists are employing the same strategy. While Arizona is the only state where such a bill has become law, elected officials have introduced similar bills in more than a dozen statehouses.\n\n\"We know this stuff has been working and the right can continue to complain about the things that the left is successful at, or they can look at it, learn from it, and replicate it,\" Michael Boldin, the founder and executive director of the Tenth Amendment Center, tells Reason.\n\nSabatini is cosponsoring a bill in Florida called the \"Second Amendment Preservation Act\" that would prohibit any employee of the state of Florida from enforcing, or attempting to enforce \"any federal act, law, executive order, administrative order, court order, rule, regulation, statute, or ordinance infringing on the right to keep and bear arms ensured by the Second Amendment.\" \n\nDefying federal law is something that a majority of states already do in one way or another, by becoming immigration sanctuaries or through the legalization and decriminalization of marijuana and other drugs that federal law still deems illegal.\n\n\"In terms of the method it's identical,\" says Sabatini. In sanctuary cities, \"they stopped reporting to or dealing with I.C.E., and that's basically what we're doing.\"\n\nBoldin says that for the nullification movement to succeed against gun control laws and beyond, more Americans will have to recognize that the most effective way to oppose federal policies that violate their rights is at the local level.\n\n\"The whole idea of federalism is so important because it's the only way you can have a country with a few hundred million people living together with a wide range of social, economic, political viewpoints together in peace. What's right for people in California is probably not right for people in South Carolina and vice versa. And when we see things that come down from a one-size-fits-all centralized solution, I don't think anyone really ever gets what they want.\"\n\nBecause 36 states have nullified federal marijuana prohibition, Boldin argues, there's mounting pressure for the federal government to follow suit. \"I think we can replicate that on other issues and learn that localism is really the way forward for liberty.\"\n\nProduced by John Osterhoudt, additional camera by Zach Weissmueller, color correction by Regan Taylor, additional graphics by Isaac Reese\n\nPhotos: Alex Milan Tracy/Sipa USA/Newscom; Nicole Neri/Reuters/Newscom; The Mises Institute; Jeff Malet Photography/Newscom."

Go to reason.com for a point of view you won't get from legacy media and old left-right opinion magazines.\n----------------\n\nPrestigious journals of opinion often emanate from prestige. Reason, on the other hand, was dreamed into existence by a 20-year-old Boston University student named Lanny Friedlander, who designed, wrote, mimeographed, and stapled together the magazine's first issues from his mother's house in Brighton, Massachusetts.\n\nBut don't let those humble beginnings fool you. Friedlander was a sharp writer, deep thinker, and remarkably avant-garde designer, influencing not only the nascent libertarian movement fermenting in Boston and New York, but also such future cutting-edge publications as Wired magazine.\n\nYet after exploding onto the world stage at such a tender age, Friedlander was gone from the pages of his own creation by the age of 25, drifting out of sight, then in and out of mental institutions. Only decades later did his own magazine track him down and reconnect; by then he had just months to live.\n\nReason's origin story is like no other comparative journal of opinion. It's time for Lanny Friedlander to get his proper due.\n\nThis video is based on the essay \"Mad Genius,\" from our December 2018 issue.\n\nWritten and narrated by Matt Welch; Motion graphics by Lex Villena and Isaac Reese; Additional b-roll by Regan Taylor\n\nMusic credits: Freeway by Wonderlust, NOTHING by wurlishmouk, Mood Swings by ZURI, Feel It by Stoic, Ascend by Arcane\n\nImage credits: Photo 186688170 \u00a9 Ulianna19970, Dreamstime.com, Photo 163720059 \u00a9 Monkey Business Images, Dreamstime.com, ID 180173350\u00a9 Gary Hider; Dreamstime.com\u00a0 ID 113267864\u00a9 Burakaykan2; Dreamstime.com\u00a0 ID 110975921\u00a9 Alexey Dmitruk; Dreamstime.com\u00a0 ID 118793808\u00a9 Katarzyna Bialasiewicz Dreamstime.com ID 26979368\u00a9 Peshkova; Dreamstime.com ID 52006629\u00a9 Everett Collection Inc.

Go to reason.com for a point of view you won't get from legacy media and old left-right opinion magazines.\n----------------\n\nPrestigious journals of opinion often emanate from prestige. Reason, on the other hand, was dreamed into existence by a 20-year-old Boston University student named Lanny Friedlander, who designed, wrote, mimeographed, and stapled together the magazine's first issues from his mother's house in Brighton, Massachusetts.\n\nBut don't let those humble beginnings fool you. Friedlander was a sharp writer, deep thinker, and remarkably avant-garde designer, influencing not only the nascent libertarian movement fermenting in Boston and New York, but also such future cutting-edge publications as Wired magazine.\n\nYet after exploding onto the world stage at such a tender age, Friedlander was gone from the pages of his own creation by the age of 25, drifting out of sight, then in and out of mental institutions. Only decades later did his own magazine track him down and reconnect; by then he had just months to live.\n\nReason's origin story is like no other comparative journal of opinion. It's time for Lanny Friedlander to get his proper due.\n\nThis video is based on the essay \"Mad Genius,\" from our December 2018 issue.\n\nWritten and narrated by Matt Welch; Motion graphics by Lex Villena and Isaac Reese; Additional b-roll by Regan Taylor\n\nMusic credits: Freeway by Wonderlust, NOTHING by wurlishmouk, Mood Swings by ZURI, Feel It by Stoic, Ascend by Arcane\n\nImage credits: Photo 186688170 \u00a9 Ulianna19970, Dreamstime.com, Photo 163720059 \u00a9 Monkey Business Images, Dreamstime.com, ID 180173350\u00a9 Gary Hider; Dreamstime.com\u00a0 ID 113267864\u00a9 Burakaykan2; Dreamstime.com\u00a0 ID 110975921\u00a9 Alexey Dmitruk; Dreamstime.com\u00a0 ID 118793808\u00a9 Katarzyna Bialasiewicz Dreamstime.com ID 26979368\u00a9 Peshkova; Dreamstime.com ID 52006629\u00a9 Everett Collection Inc.

Go to reason.com for a point of view you won't get from legacy media and old left-right opinion magazines.\n----------------\nTech billionaire Elon Musk is known for leading Tesla and SpaceX, as one of the visionaries behind PayPal, and for hyping bitcoin and a bold plan to colonize Mars.\n\nHe's not just one of the planet's richest people, he's one of its biggest recipients of government handouts, according to Lisa Conyers and Phil Harvey, authors of Welfare for the Rich: How Your Tax Dollars End Up in Millionaires' Pockets\u2014And What You Can do About It. Conyers is a veteran journalist and co-author with Harvey of 2016's The Human Cost of Welfare. Harvey is a successful businessman and philanthropist who supports many libertarian organizations, including Reason Foundation, the nonprofit that publishes this website.\n\nBy 2015, companies led by Musk had already gotten billions in subsidies, tax breaks, and other handouts. He's not alone. There are thousands of other immensely rich people who are constantly milking the government for special perks, carveouts, and handouts.\n\nHere are five of the very worst ways they do that.\n\n1. Agricultural Subsidies\n\nSince 1933, when Congress passed the first farm support bill, the government has been shoveling billions of dollars in the form of crop insurance, cash payouts, and other subsidies to the smaller and smaller number of American farmers. As Conyers and Harvey document, former Obama commerce secretary and billionaire Penny Pritzker received $1.6 million in subsidies between 1996 and 2006, and current Republican South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem was part of a family business that got over $3 million in subsidies between 1995 and 2008.\n\n2. Sugar Subsidies\n\nBecause of protectionist tariffs and price supports, Americans pay around triple the world price for sugar, thanks to efforts by billionaires like Fanjul brothers, Alfy and Pepe, dubbed \"the first family of corporate welfare\" by Time magazine.\n\n3. Stadium Deals\n\nMany, if not most, major pro sports team owners are billionaires.\n\nYet between 1997 and 2015, almost half of all construction costs for new NFL stadiums were covered by taxpayers. In the case of Raymond James Stadium, home to Super Bowl champs the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, taxpayers ponied up 100 percent of building costs. Plus, the team basically gets all revenue generated at the stadium too.\n\n4. Mickey Mouse Subsidies\n\nThe Walt Disney Corporation, with a market cap of $368 billion, is the heavyweight champ among theme park operators when it comes to sweetheart deals. Disney \"returned $2.3 billion to investors in 2017 alone\" write Conyers and Harvey, and Bob Iger, chairman and CEO, \"earns $45 million a year.\" So of course Disneyland, located in Anaheim, California, needs handouts.\n\nTwenty-five years ago, Anaheim built Disney a new parking structure that cost $108 million and then leased it to the company for the high price of $1 a year. In 2015, the city agreed to exempt the park from paying entertainment taxes for 45 years, and in 2016, it agreed to a $650 million tax rebate on a luxury hotel Disney built near \"the happiest place on Earth.\"\n\n5. Energy Freebies\n\nOver the past decade, Peabody, the largest private coal company in the world, pulled in around $275 million in state and federal subsidies while generating $5.6 billion in revenue in 2017. Exelon, a power company that specializes in nuclear energy, generated $34 billion in revenue in 2017, the year after it gulled New York state into giving it $7.6 billion to keep four aging and underperforming nuclear power plants going.\n\nA few years back, New York state also shelled out $750 million to build a factory for Elon Musk's renewable energy company Solar City. Elected officials then decreed the company would pay no property taxes for a decade, saving the billionaire another $260 million.\n\nBut as Conyers and Harvey argue, in our information-rich world, citizen activists are fighting back. In Louisiana, when one group learned that Exxon and other gas and oil companies were getting away without paying property taxes, it led to a new public accountability law.\n\nThey also point to websites that track subsidies and handouts, empowering citizens to protest the use of tax dollars to gild the pockets of mega-corporations and the billionaires who own them.\n\nIf and when Elon Musk actually makes it to Mars, let's make sure he buys his own ticket.\n\nNarrated by Nick Gillespie.

Go to reason.com for a point of view you won't get from legacy media and old left-right opinion magazines.\n----------------\nA majority of California's K-12 schools have been closed for in-person instruction for an entire year. During this time, the federal government has given California schools about $8 billion to retrofit buildings for better ventilation, to stock up on masks and sanitation gear, to create rapid COVID testing procedures, and to reconfigure classrooms to maintain more distance between students.\n\nEven California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has overseen one of the strictest lockdowns in the nation, says it's time for schools to re-open for in-person instruction\u2014now.\n\n\"If everybody has to be vaccinated we might as well just tell people the truth,\" Newsom said during an online symposium with school administrators. \"There will be no in-person instruction in the state of California.\"\n\nThe state government has also earmarked an additional $2 billion for school districts willing to re-open K-2 classrooms by the end of March.

They don't have to deal with benefit packages, coverage denials, hidden costs, in network vs. out of network, or any surprises whatsoever. Instead, their patients buy the medical equivalent of a Netflix subscription.\n\nAt $75 per month for adults, \"We make it cheaper than a cell phone,\" says Dr. Gross. \"If you can afford a cell phone, you can afford the most basic aspect of healthcare delivery in the United States.\"\n\nDoctors Crouch and Gross are pioneers in a growing national movement called direct primary care. Tired of dealing with insurance companies when it comes to routine medical services, physicians around the country have exited the traditional system and are saying they can provide better care at a lower price by charging their patients a nominal monthly fee directly.\n\nThey're demonstrating that making American healthcare flexible and affordable requires abandoning the use of third-party insurance for routine care and adopting a market-based approach.\n\n\"Direct primary care is about as close to a free market in healthcare as you've ever seen in our country,\" says Dr. Gross, who also serves on the Florida Medical Association's Council on Medical Economics and Practice Innovation. \"We have never tried a true marketplace in healthcare. We have competition, but we have competition in a price fixed system with very opaque prices.\"\n\nWhen Crouch and Gross converted to direct primary care in 2010, they estimate that there were fewer than a dozen practices using this model. Today there are approximately 1,400 independent Direct Primary Care practices in 49 states. Virtually all of them charge a subscription fee that's between $50 and $100 monthly to consult with the doctor at any time in-person or from home.\n\nNot only does this model result in lower prices, but the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that direct primary care is more flexible as well. According to a survey conducted in July, 78 percent of physicians had seen a decline in patient volume because of COVID-19. In March, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued a temporary waiver stating that Medicare would pay the same rate for certain kinds of video telemedicine visits as in-person ones. But the types of visits it would cover changed over the course of the year and are still changing.\n\nWhether insurance companies and the government continue covering online visits after the pandemic has no bearing on Crouch and Gross. And they didn't have to wait for insurance companies and the government to OK telemedicine in the first place.\n\n\"We didn't need to wait for BlueCross to convene a committee to pay for telemedicine services,\" Gross says. \"I didn't need to wait two months or three months for Medicare to create a new billing code in order for me to provide technology visits for a patient\u2026Instantly from in-person practice, we were an online practice. We were a parking lot practice. We were a house call practice. We did whatever we had to do in order to get the patient the proper care at the proper time.\"\n\nGross adds that \"for what Medicare pays for a single technology visit, I provide two to three months of unlimited technology visits, unlimited office visits, unlimited home visits, unlimited email visits. And so now the model is, again, pandemic tested. It's proven that it's actually a superior model because we have the built-in flexibility to do what we need at the time we need it.\"\n\nThirty-two states and D.C. have passed laws requiring insurance companies to reimburse doctors at the same rate for telemedicine visits as they do for comparable in-person visits. Dr. Gross says that shouldn't be decided by lobbyists, lawmakers, or government administrators. Prices should be set through market competition.\n\n\"The myth is that profit by its mere definition does not belong in the American healthcare system. And it's evil and creates perverse incentives\u2026The key to making that profit work is, again, the elimination of that third party in the middle of that profit, which just drives up costs, but adds no value.\"\n\nProduced by John Osterhoudt.

Go to reason.com for a point of view you won't get from legacy media and old left-right opinion magazines.\n----------------\n\"I was still a Marxist after taking Milton Friedman's course [at the University of Chicago],\" says free market economist and social critic Thomas Sowell. \"One summer in the government was enough to let me say government is really not the answer.\"\n\nKnown for provocative and best-selling books such as Knowledge and Decisions, A Conflict of Visions, and last year's Charter Schools and Their Enemies, the internationally renowned scholar is the subject of a new documentary and biography, both authored by Jason L. Riley, a Manhattan Institute senior fellow and Wall Street Journal columnist. Beyond the breadth and depth of his interests, what sets Sowell apart is that he \"puts truth above popularity and doesn't concern himself with being politically correct,\" Riley tells Reason's Nick Gillespie. \"It's an adherence to empiricism, to facts and logic and putting that ahead of theory. [Sowell] is much more interested in how an idea has panned out\u2026rather than simply what the intent is.\"\n\nAmong Sowell's chief insights are the realizations that there are no perfect solutions, only tradeoffs, and that information, knowledge, and wisdom are dispersed throughout society, often in unarticulated ways that experts and elitists ignore. As Sowell wrote in his memoir, growing up poor and segregated during the Depression, he had \"daily contact with people who were neither well-educated nor particularly genteel, but who had practical wisdom far beyond what I had,\" which gave him \"a lasting respect for the common sense of ordinary people, a factor routinely ignored by the intellectuals among whom I would later make my career.\"\n\nAt age 90, Sowell is still writing and publishing.

Go to reason.com for a point of view you won't get from legacy media and old left-right opinion magazines.\n----------------\n\"I was still a Marxist after taking Milton Friedman's course [at the University of Chicago],\" says free market economist and social critic Thomas Sowell. \"One summer in the government was enough to let me say government is really not the answer.\"\n\nKnown for provocative and best-selling books such as Knowledge and Decisions, A Conflict of Visions, and last year's Charter Schools and Their Enemies, the internationally renowned scholar is the subject of a new documentary and biography, both authored by Jason L. Riley, a Manhattan Institute senior fellow and Wall Street Journal columnist. Beyond the breadth and depth of his interests, what sets Sowell apart is that he \"puts truth above popularity and doesn't concern himself with being politically correct,\" Riley tells Reason's Nick Gillespie. \"It's an adherence to empiricism, to facts and logic and putting that ahead of theory. [Sowell] is much more interested in how an idea has panned out\u2026rather than simply what the intent is.\"\n\nAmong Sowell's chief insights are the realizations that there are no perfect solutions, only tradeoffs, and that information, knowledge, and wisdom are dispersed throughout society, often in unarticulated ways that experts and elitists ignore. As Sowell wrote in his memoir, growing up poor and segregated during the Depression, he had \"daily contact with people who were neither well-educated nor particularly genteel, but who had practical wisdom far beyond what I had,\" which gave him \"a lasting respect for the common sense of ordinary people, a factor routinely ignored by the intellectuals among whom I would later make my career.\"\n\nAt age 90, Sowell is still writing and publishing. His greatest scholarship may be behind him, but his body of work will continue to have a profound impact on our understanding of the world long after he's gone.\n\nNarrated by Nick Gillespie.

Go to reason.com for a point of view you won't get from legacy media and old left-right opinion magazines.\n----------------\n\"Blackstone is one of the largest landlords in [the] world,\" tweeted the New York tenant advocacy group Housing Justice for All in May. \"We know they're rich enough to #CancelRent, and we're going to make them.\"\n\nAnd then there's Chao Huai Gao, an immigrant from Zhengzhou, China. He owns a modest two-story house in Queens and isn't rich enough to forgo rental income. He tells Reason that the emotional distress of having an occupant who isn't paying rent and who he can't evict has him contemplating \"jumping off of a building.\"\n\nGao came to the U.S. in 1999, working in New York restaurants and nail salons and doing interior renovation. \"I haven't taken a day off since I came to America,\" he says. In 2017, he and his wife, who is a caretaker, made a down payment on a house as an investment property, supplementing their savings with a loan from their family in China. To cover their mortgage, they rented out both floors and moved into a cheap studio apartment nearby with their two young daughters.\n\nIn March 2020, the college students sharing the second-floor apartment gave notice that they were moving out. After the apartment was vacated, a neighbor alerted Gao that he noticed that the lights were on at night. Soon after, Gao discovered that one of his former tenants had given her keys to a friend who had moved in without permission.\u00a0\n\nGao has never met the squatter now living in his house and is afraid to contact this person out of fear that he'll be sued for harassment.\u00a0The squatter, who is a dropout from an elite private university, has never offered to pay rent. (Reason was unable to reach him for comment, so we're not including his name in this story.)\u00a0\n\nUnder New York state law, because the squatter has been in the apartment for more than 30 days, retaking possession will require a court order\u2014but Gao can't obtain a court order, because New York's housing courts have been mostly closed during the pandemic. Gao tells Reason that he's in a state of personal crisis, hemorrhaging money, and consumed with worry about losing his home.\n\nGao is part of an association of about 200 Chinese immigrant landlords in New York City with tenants who have stopped paying rent. They're speaking out about the impact of the government's decision to temporarily halt evictions\u2014a policy championed by the #CancelRent movement. On September 4, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a national eviction moratorium that is currently set to expire at the end of March. New York is one of many states that has also passed a series of administrative orders and temporary laws halting evictions on top of the CDC order.\u00a0\n\nAlthough technically these measures are intended to help tenants directly impacted by the pandemic, in practice they've brought New York's eviction proceedings to a complete halt. From mid-March through the end of November, in a typical year, there would have been about 14,000 evictions in New York City. In 2020, over this same period, there were just 2. New York now has a backlog of 200,000 eviction cases that pre-date COVID-19.\u00a0\n\nContinue reading: https://reason.com/video/2021/02/23/the-victims-of-the-eviction-moratorium/\n\nPhoto Credits: Erik McGregor/Sipa USA/Newscom; Erik McGregor/Sipa USA/Newscom; Erik McGregor/Sipa USA/Newscom; Brian Branch Price/ZUMA Press/Newscom; Erik McGregor/Sipa USA/Newscom; Brian Branch Price/ZUMA Press/Newscom; Erik McGregor/Sipa USA/Newscom; Erik McGregor/Sipa USA/Newscom; Erik McGregor/Sipa USA/Newscom; Erik McGregor/Sipa USA/Newscom; Erik McGregor/Sipa USA/Newscom; Brian Branch Price/ZUMA Press/Newscom; Brian Branch Price/ZUMA Press/Newscom; Brian Branch Price/ZUMA Press/Newscom; 1354732 \u00a9 Jimmy Lopes | Dreamstime.com;ID\u00a03180810\u00a0\u00a9\u00a0Photo168\u00a0|\u00a0Dreamstime.com; SMXRF/starmaxinc.com/Newscom; Erik McGregor/Sipa USA/Newscom; Erik McGregor/Sipa USA/Newscom\n\nFootage Credit: Damian Bartolacci/Pond5\n\nMusic Credits: \"January,\" by Kai Engel, Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0).\n\nWritten and produced by Jim Epstein; graphics by Isaac Reese; translation by Shuang Li; audio post-production by Ian Keyser",

That was New York Times tech columnist Kevin Roose's suggestion for how the Biden administration could help solve the so-called \"reality crisis\" facing the country. \n\nThe chaotic events of the January 6 Capitol riots marked the beginning of a new era of online content moderation. Not only did every major social media company kick Trump off their platforms, but Amazon Web Services, which owns about a third of the global cloud storage market, evicted the Twitter competitor Parler, and Apple and Google removed it from their app stores. Parler, which had signed on more than 13 million users, announced its relaunch on February 16.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans want Washington to have more influence over how big tech companies operate. There is a bi-partisan push to repeal Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, known as the internet's First Amendment, which would give the government more power to hold social media companies liable for the content that appears on their platforms. \n\nPresident Biden has gone on the record in support of repealing Section 230. When, during an interview with then candidate Biden, the New York Times's editorial board called the regulation foundational to the modern internet, Biden responded, \"That's right. Exactly right. And it should be revoked.\"\n\nBut the great deplatforming of 2021 has also energized the movement to build a new, radically decentralized internet that would allow users to escape whatever form the Reality Czar takes. Many of the projects in this space are trying different approaches to solving the same set of problems, such as how to give individuals control over their own digital identities, and how to store data in the cloud so that it can't be controlled or accessed by a large company subject to political pressure from the state.\n\nMuneeb Ali is the CEO of Stacks, which has garnered some major backing for its effort to build a new computing platform that could become the foundation for a new decentralized internet. \n\n\"Regardless of which side of the debate you're on with certain political figures getting banned on social media platforms that is not the point,\" said Ali. \"The point is no one should have that type of power.\"\n\nA project called Filecoin is building a decentralized cloud storage system that allows computers all over the world to contribute space on their hard drives, which can be accessed through the InterPlanetary File System, an alternative protocol to the \"http\" that underpins today's web. In exchange, they get paid with a digital token. If Parler ran on IPFS and Filecoin, it would be difficult for a government or any third-party actor, like Amazon, to shut down their service. \n\n\"In a world in which you can truly take your data with you and take the app with you and everything, you have so much more control\" said Molly Mackinlay, a project lead for IPFS \n\n\"We just address the problem at its root. It's like, all right, well, may as well just rewrite it.\" said  Gaken Wolfe-Pauly, co-founder of Urbit.\n\nUrbit is an entirely new operating system that Wolfe-Pauly envisions becoming as all purpose as WeChat is in China, which allows users to make social media posts, send direct messages, make calls, play games, hail taxis and pay bills online and in-person. Except with Urbit, the user owns all the data, as opposed to a Chinese company that shares it with the government to monitor the activities of its citizens.\n\nProduced by Zach Weissmueller.

Go to reason.com for a point of view you won't get from legacy media and old left-right opinion magazines.\n\n----------------\n\nCarl Hart is a 54-year-old Air Force veteran, a professor of psychology at Columbia University, and an unapologetic recreational user of heroin.\"I use heroin,\" he tells Reason, \"in part because it's really good at helping me to unwind, to be more forgiving of other people, to look at my own behavior and see where I need to modify in order to be a more responsible person, in order to be a better person.\"Hart's new book, Drug Use for Grown-Ups: Chasing Liberty in the Land of Fear, is a provocative manifesto for legalizing all drugs and letting responsible adults use the intoxicants of their choosing.

The industry's gradual deterioration was 18 years in the making, tracing back to then-President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's 2003 decision to fire the oil industry's most experienced engineers in an act of petty political retribution.\n\nThe near-total collapse in the nation's oil output in the ensuing years is a stark reminder that the most valuable commodity isn't a natural resource, but the human expertise to put it to productive use.\n\nThe little gas that is still available comes via periodic shipments from Iran. But the Venezuelan government doesn't officially charge at most gas stations. It uses a quota system, so filling a tank can mean waiting in line for days.\n\nThe Venezuelan oil industry turned a once poor agricultural nation into an important geopolitical player and one of the region's richest countries.\u00a0\n\nThe economic crisis has caused much of the nation's educated middle class to flee the country, which will make rebuilding Venezuela's human capital an even greater challenge. In an ironic twist, Chavez's hand-picked successor, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, is now working to bring privately-run foreign oil companies back in.\n\nProduced by Andr\u00e9s Figueredo Thomson and Regan Taylor; translation by Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Inojosa Salina.\n\nMusic Credits: Homeroad, Nothing, and Run by Kai Engel; Suspect Located by Scott Holmes\n\nPhoto Credits: JORGE SILVA/REUTERS/Newscom; Juan Carlos Hernandez/ZUMA Press/Newscom; KIMBERLY WHITE/REUTER/Newscom;",
