                "description": "Facebook censors my video, calling it \u201cpartly false.\u201d\n----\nTo make sure you receive the weekly video from Stossel TV, sign up here: https://johnstossel.activehosted.com/f/1\n----\nBefore Facebook censored it, my video, \u201cAre We Doomed\u201d, got more 24 million views. \n\nYou can watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8JZo6PzpCU\n\nNow Facebook won't show it to many people \u2014 not even to my subscribers. Facebook's also punishing Stossel TV by showing our other videos less.  \n\nAll because Facebook foolishly gave Emmanuel Vincent, a recent PhD graduate from France, the power to censor.  \n\nVincent assembled a group of like-minded scientists into a group called Climate Feedback climatefeedback.org that declared parts of my video \u201cmisleading,\" or \"partially false.\" \n\nWhat facts did the \u201cfact-checkers\u201d correct?  NONE!  There was not a single hard fact that in the video that was wrong.   \n\nWe address the censor\u2019s claims here, listing our sources: https://www.johnstossel.com/climate-feedback-response/\n\nI asked one Vincent \u201creviewer,\u201d the only one willing to be interviewed, why I deserve censorship even though our facts were correct.\n\n\u201cThe problem is the omission of contextual information rather than specific \"facts\" being \"wrong,\u201d\" says Patrick Brown, Assistant Professor at San Jose State University.\n\nSome \u201cfact-check.\"\n\n\u201cWhat kills me,\u201d I complain to Brown, \u201cis that when Climate Feedback rates me partly false, that significantly reduces the number of people who see it -- and see my other videos. So this is really important to me that it be done fairly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am sympathetic with what you're saying,\u201d he responds.  \u201cAt the same time as a\nconsumer of information, I like the idea of having some type of system where content can be compared to what experts think.\u201d  \n\nBut Facebook\u2019s choice of \"experts\" is absurd.    \n\nEmmanuel Vincent proudly says \u201call the climate scientists that I know personally agree that climate change is real, that it\u2019s serious, and we can do something about it.\u201d\n\nWell, of course climate change is real!   But how serious a threat it is, and whether we can do much about it with today\u2019s technology deserves debate. Victor\u2019s little group STOPS debate.\n\nRemarkably, Facebook lets them.\n\nWatch the video above and decide for yourself.",

                    "description": "Facebook censors my video, calling it \u201cpartly false.\u201d\n----\nTo make sure you receive the weekly video from Stossel TV, sign up here: https://johnstossel.activehosted.com/f/1\n----\nBefore Facebook censored it, my video, \u201cAre We Doomed\u201d, got more 24 million views. \n\nYou can watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8JZo6PzpCU\n\nNow Facebook won't show it to many people \u2014 not even to my subscribers. Facebook's also punishing Stossel TV by showing our other videos less.  \n\nAll because Facebook foolishly gave Emmanuel Vincent, a recent PhD graduate from France, the power to censor.  \n\nVincent assembled a group of like-minded scientists into a group called Climate Feedback climatefeedback.org that declared parts of my video \u201cmisleading,\" or \"partially false.\" \n\nWhat facts did the \u201cfact-checkers\u201d correct?  NONE!  There was not a single hard fact that in the video that was wrong.   \n\nWe address the censor\u2019s claims here, listing our sources: https://www.johnstossel.com/climate-feedback-response/\n\nI asked one Vincent \u201creviewer,\u201d the only one willing to be interviewed, why I deserve censorship even though our facts were correct.\n\n\u201cThe problem is the omission of contextual information rather than specific \"facts\" being \"wrong,\u201d\" says Patrick Brown, Assistant Professor at San Jose State University.\n\nSome \u201cfact-check.\"\n\n\u201cWhat kills me,\u201d I complain to Brown, \u201cis that when Climate Feedback rates me partly false, that significantly reduces the number of people who see it -- and see my other videos. So this is really important to me that it be done fairly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am sympathetic with what you're saying,\u201d he responds.  \u201cAt the same time as a\nconsumer of information, I like the idea of having some type of system where content can be compared to what experts think.\u201d  \n\nBut Facebook\u2019s choice of \"experts\" is absurd.    \n\nEmmanuel Vincent proudly says \u201call the climate scientists that I know personally agree that climate change is real, that it\u2019s serious, and we can do something about it.\u201d\n\nWell, of course climate change is real!   But how serious a threat it is, and whether we can do much about it with today\u2019s technology deserves debate. Victor\u2019s little group STOPS debate.\n\nRemarkably, Facebook lets them.\n\nWatch the video above and decide for yourself."

It will be costlier than it should be because of politicians who hold up promising developments to help their cronies.\n----\nTo make sure you receive the weekly video from Stossel TV, sign up here: https://johnstossel.activehosted.com/f/1\n----\nI first covered the hold-up about 3 years ago, after I confronted Edgewater, New Jersey mayor Michael McPartland.\n\n\"Are you on the take?\" I asked at a town council meeting, after he'd ignored interview requests.\n\nHe never answered.\n\nMcPartland was accused of corruptly blocking an exciting new development of hundreds of waterfront apartments -- all to protect his powerful developer friend Fred Daibes. \n\nHe and other city council members lived in one of Daibes' buildings.  \n\nA lawsuit alleged that nearly 2,000 competing apartments were blocked by Daibes and the town council.  \n\nThe mayor and council got aggressive, even at one point attempting to seize the competing developer's land using eminent domain. That was stopped in court.\n\nSince my first reporting, a few things have changed. After the developer sued, claiming corruption, McPartland and the city council switched sides. The corruption suit was dropped, and the politicians agreed to approve most of the developer's proposed construction.\n\nSadly, the exciting development still remains unbuilt. That's because now a spa \u2014 with close connections to Daibes, according to the developer \u2014 has sued Edgewater, saying the council was not allowed to approve the development under duress of a corruption lawsuit.\n\nThanks to politicians, lawyers, and their cronies, beautiful waterfront property remains... a dump.  Taxpayers, and renters, lose.",

                    "description": "Want an apartment in New Jersey? It will be costlier than it should be because of politicians who hold up promising developments to help their cronies.\n----\nTo make sure you receive the weekly video from Stossel TV, sign up here: https://johnstossel.activehosted.com/f/1\n----\nI first covered the hold-up about 3 years ago, after I confronted Edgewater, New Jersey mayor Michael McPartland.\n\n\"Are you on the take?\" I asked at a town council meeting, after he'd ignored interview requests.\n\nHe never answered.\n\nMcPartland was accused of corruptly blocking an exciting new development of hundreds of waterfront apartments -- all to protect his powerful developer friend Fred Daibes. \n\nHe and other city council members lived in one of Daibes' buildings.  \n\nA lawsuit alleged that nearly 2,000 competing apartments were blocked by Daibes and the town council.  \n\nThe mayor and council got aggressive, even at one point attempting to seize the competing developer's land using eminent domain. That was stopped in court.\n\nSince my first reporting, a few things have changed. After the developer sued, claiming corruption, McPartland and the city council switched sides. The corruption suit was dropped, and the politicians agreed to approve most of the developer's proposed construction.\n\nSadly, the exciting development still remains unbuilt. That's because now a spa \u2014 with close connections to Daibes, according to the developer \u2014 has sued Edgewater, saying the council was not allowed to approve the development under duress of a corruption lawsuit.\n\nThanks to politicians, lawyers, and their cronies, beautiful waterfront property remains... a dump.  Taxpayers, and renters, lose."
