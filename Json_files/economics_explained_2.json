What\u2019s more, is that of course banks will tell you this because they really need depositors\u2019 money to use as collateral for borrowing more money which they will then invest or lend out to the general public which is how they make their profits. \n\nBut there is much more to it than that. \n\nEnjoyed the video?

Well, that wasn\u2019t the reason the government did this. \n\nDuring World War 2 these little islands were an incredibly important naval base in the middle of the pacific, and even to this day Pearl Harbor is the headquarters of the US Navy\u2019s pacific fleet, but it also was and still is a regular place filled with regular people going about their regular days spending their regular dollars. \n\nThis was a real problem during the war in the pacific when a Japanese invasion was an imminent threat. \n\nDespite the devastating Strategic blow this could have been, it would also give Japanese forces the ability to plunder a huge supply of American cash that would be left behind by banks businesses and individuals on the island. \n\nAn enemy force having access to such a huge supply of your home currency is bad news because it can be an effective tool in espionage, weapons procurement or even economic warfare.\n\nSo the solution was simple, all currency in circulation on Hawaii was to be marked as Hawaiian dollars. These dollars were exactly the same as American dollars and could even be used on the mainland if one was so inclined. \n\nHowever, in the event that japan did successfully invade Hawaii the government could quickly declare that all bills market with this Hawaii stamp are no longer valid currency. \n\nNow you might be asking. what about those poor people that happened to have Hawaiian dollars at this time? Well this was the reason that Hawaiian residents were incentivized not to carry that much cash, only having enough to cover their day to day expenses and then keeping everything else in a bank. \n\nAlso for what it\u2019s worth chances are if the Japanese had invaded the people of Hawaii would probably have bigger problems on their plate than losing some cash savings. \n\nNow the banks that held this cash simply reported it to the federal reserve and in a situation where the island was lost the central bank would simply reimburse them for the lost currency. \n\nThe united states put so much effort into this system because a lot of the strength of the US Economy comes from the trust that people have in it\u2019s currency, and the guarantee that it will always be honoured by the government. \n\nA situation where some cash in circulation is tainted because it came from an adversarial foreign power therefore the government won\u2019t accept it would destroy the fungibility of the dollar and quickly ruin the trust that people had in it and his trust is never more important than during times of war. \n\nEven today foreign US military basses remain mostly cashless, Using the Eagle card instead. This is estimated to save the US government millions of dollars a year in security and logistics, while also ensuring that freedom dollars remain exactly that. \n\n\n\n\nEnjoyed the video?

Well, that wasn\u2019t the reason the government did this. \n\nDuring World War 2 these little islands were an incredibly important naval base in the middle of the pacific, and even to this day Pearl Harbor is the headquarters of the US Navy\u2019s pacific fleet, but it also was and still is a regular place filled with regular people going about their regular days spending their regular dollars. \n\nThis was a real problem during the war in the pacific when a Japanese invasion was an imminent threat. \n\nDespite the devastating Strategic blow this could have been, it would also give Japanese forces the ability to plunder a huge supply of American cash that would be left behind by banks businesses and individuals on the island. \n\nAn enemy force having access to such a huge supply of your home currency is bad news because it can be an effective tool in espionage, weapons procurement or even economic warfare.\n\nSo the solution was simple, all currency in circulation on Hawaii was to be marked as Hawaiian dollars. These dollars were exactly the same as American dollars and could even be used on the mainland if one was so inclined. \n\nHowever, in the event that japan did successfully invade Hawaii the government could quickly declare that all bills market with this Hawaii stamp are no longer valid currency. \n\nNow you might be asking. what about those poor people that happened to have Hawaiian dollars at this time? Well this was the reason that Hawaiian residents were incentivized not to carry that much cash, only having enough to cover their day to day expenses and then keeping everything else in a bank. \n\nAlso for what it\u2019s worth chances are if the Japanese had invaded the people of Hawaii would probably have bigger problems on their plate than losing some cash savings. \n\nNow the banks that held this cash simply reported it to the federal reserve and in a situation where the island was lost the central bank would simply reimburse them for the lost currency. \n\nThe united states put so much effort into this system because a lot of the strength of the US Economy comes from the trust that people have in it\u2019s currency, and the guarantee that it will always be honoured by the government. \n\nA situation where some cash in circulation is tainted because it came from an adversarial foreign power therefore the government won\u2019t accept it would destroy the fungibility of the dollar and quickly ruin the trust that people had in it and his trust is never more important than during times of war. \n\nEven today foreign US military basses remain mostly cashless, Using the Eagle card instead. This is estimated to save the US government millions of dollars a year in security and logistics, while also ensuring that freedom dollars remain exactly that. \n\n\n\n\nEnjoyed the video?
