There's no big difference between the blue and the red box, but it just uses slightly different designs and the color.\n\nI'm trying to continue adding to my Battle Styles binder, and lucky for me Battle Styles is one of the most affordable products out there at the moment, from the booster box to the ETB, and seeing as I needed a nice place to store my Battle Styles bulk cards, I had no problem picking up this box!\n\nIf you're out there looking to just being able to open an elite trainer box, this really could be the product for you, this isn't a favorite set for everyone, but in all honesty, it's not bad, and as far as the higher end cards of the set like the alternate art Tyranitar V, or even just the VMAX cards like Victini VMAX or Flapple VMAX, in my opinion you can't go wrong here for the price!\n\nyou'd like to keep up with me, make sure to check me\nout on social media:\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kirksicle_ig/\ntwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/kirksicle\ntik tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@kirksicle?\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Intro\n2:31 Break Seal\n5:41 Pack 1\n6:57 Pack 2\n8:20 Pack 3\n10:12 Pack 4\n11:51 Pack 5\n13:00 Pack 6\n14:41 Pack 7\n17:04 Pack 8\n18:35 Outro\n\nWe out here still looking for drunk Tyranitar, and just plainly if you're a person of science, I'd say this is a fair sample of the battle styles etb pull rates. If you'd like to see me open more to make a red urshifu box fight against the blue urshifu box, let me know, we can be on the search for more battle styles etb, for these are cheap pokemon etb.",

                    "description": "With the previous fluctuation of Pokemon card products finally returning back to something more normal, the need for a cheap elite trainer box is what you might be looking for, and from that we arrive at this Battle Styles ETB opening, but more specifically the Battle Styles Elite Trainer Box red, for the red Urshifu. There's no big difference between the blue and the red box, but it just uses slightly different designs and the color.\n\nI'm trying to continue adding to my Battle Styles binder, and lucky for me Battle Styles is one of the most affordable products out there at the moment, from the booster box to the ETB, and seeing as I needed a nice place to store my Battle Styles bulk cards, I had no problem picking up this box!\n\nIf you're out there looking to just being able to open an elite trainer box, this really could be the product for you, this isn't a favorite set for everyone, but in all honesty, it's not bad, and as far as the higher end cards of the set like the alternate art Tyranitar V, or even just the VMAX cards like Victini VMAX or Flapple VMAX, in my opinion you can't go wrong here for the price!\n\nyou'd like to keep up with me, make sure to check me\nout on social media:\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kirksicle_ig/\ntwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/kirksicle\ntik tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@kirksicle?\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Intro\n2:31 Break Seal\n5:41 Pack 1\n6:57 Pack 2\n8:20 Pack 3\n10:12 Pack 4\n11:51 Pack 5\n13:00 Pack 6\n14:41 Pack 7\n17:04 Pack 8\n18:35 Outro\n\nWe out here still looking for drunk Tyranitar, and just plainly if you're a person of science, I'd say this is a fair sample of the battle styles etb pull rates. If you'd like to see me open more to make a red urshifu box fight against the blue urshifu box, let me know, we can be on the search for more battle styles etb, for these are cheap pokemon etb."

I'm starting to build an opinion as far as where the prime pulls come from as far as all of the shining fates products, this one might be the one in all honesty. There's a reason why there's the word premium on the box, and I'm starting to believe it! We're after the zard and the tar as I also sneak in a few battle styles packs in there. Regardless, there's a lot of cards missing as part of the master sets that I'm working on, so the pulls are awesome more often than not.\n\nAre you still chasing any cards for Shining fates, or are you just waiting for some Eevee heroes, or Chilling Reign, let me know!\n\nyou'd like to keep up with me, make sure to check me\nout on social media:\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/kirksicle_ig/\ntwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/kirksicle\ntik tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@kirksicle?\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Intro\n2:10 Jumbo Card Storage\n4:21 pack 1\n6:50 pack 2\n8:59 pack 3\n10:19 pack 4\n11:42 pack 5\n12:39 pack 6\n14:04 pack 7\n15:37 bonus pack 1\n17:05 bonus pack 2\n18:27 bonus pack 3\n19:36 recap\n20:20 Outro"

Meowth of course has the Meowth VMAX Collection box, and with the shinning fates set came out a Pikachu V Collection box set.\n\nIn general Shining fates is known for pulling hits after hits with it's amazing rares, and the entirety of the shiny vault collection, one might say that this is a done battle, but looking at the Meowth collection set, it has a great variety of packs, we've got an XY Evolutions, Unified Minds, and not 1, but 2 Cosmic Eclipse! Aside from the packs in general, we have special V cards for both, but long boi Meowth has a VMAX card. If that wasn't enough to call these great sets to begin with they also come with awesome Jumbo cards!\n\nAssuming you'd see both of these on a shelf, which one would you be inclined to pick up?\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Intro\n1:30 McDonald's Pack\n2:54 Jumbo Card 1\n3:50 Jumbo Card 2\n4:30 Pikachu V Collection packs opening\n11:38 Jumbo Card 3\n13:30 Meowth VMax Collection packs opening\n19:30 Outro"

Originally I was trying to get the platinum trophy but I wasn't counting on time relics as being a thing that needed to be done, which then created the need to play all these levels so many times. I never thought I'd be getting good at Crash Bandicoot 2, but through this journey I could at least see a glimpse of that.\n\nMake sure to Like and subscribe, If you liked these Crash 2 streams, or if you're a fan of more Crash 2 twitch streams!\n\nAlso to catch the streams live, go check it out at:\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/Kirksicle\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Intro\n1:00 Crash Crush Early Gold Attempt\n2:00 Crash Crush Gold Victory Run\n3:52 The Eel Deal Early Gold Attempt\n5:52 The Eel Deal Gold Victory Run\n7:22 Plant Food Early Gold Attempt\n8:44 Plant Food Gold Victory Run\n10:01 Sewer Or Later Early Gold Attempt\n11:04 Sewer Or Later Gold Victory Run\n12:06 Bear Down Early Gold Attempt\n13:46 Bear Down Gold Victory Run\n\nI will be posting more videos of me to some degree getting good at Crash Bandicoot 2, or at least to a reasonable human level! They will all be part of a Crash Bandicoot 2 twitch stream, but more specifically a N Sane Trilogy twitch stream.",

Originally I was trying to get the platinum trophy but I wasn't counting on time relics as being a thing that needed to be done, which then created the need to play all these levels so many times. I never thought I'd be getting good at Crash Bandicoot 2, but through this journey I could at least see a glimpse of that.\n\nMake sure to Like and subscribe, If you liked these Crash 2 streams, or if you're a fan of more Crash 2 twitch streams!\n\nAlso to catch the streams live, go check it out at:\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/Kirksicle\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Intro\n1:00 Crash Crush Early Gold Attempt\n2:00 Crash Crush Gold Victory Run\n3:52 The Eel Deal Early Gold Attempt\n5:52 The Eel Deal Gold Victory Run\n7:22 Plant Food Early Gold Attempt\n8:44 Plant Food Gold Victory Run\n10:01 Sewer Or Later Early Gold Attempt\n11:04 Sewer Or Later Gold Victory Run\n12:06 Bear Down Early Gold Attempt\n13:46 Bear Down Gold Victory Run\n\nI will be posting more videos of me to some degree getting good at Crash Bandicoot 2, or at least to a reasonable human level! They will all be part of a Crash Bandicoot 2 twitch stream, but more specifically a N Sane Trilogy twitch stream."
